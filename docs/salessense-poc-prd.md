# SalesSense AI - Sales Call Feedback POC
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## **Project Overview**

**SalesSense AI** is an agentic AI-powered tool designed to provide intelligent feedback and insights on sales calls. The system analyzes Dialpad call recordings, transcribes them, and leverages multiple AI agents to deliver actionable feedback to sales representatives, helping them improve their performance and close more deals.

### **Problem Statement**
Sales teams often struggle to:
- Identify what went well or poorly in their calls
- Get consistent, objective feedback on their performance
- Scale coaching across large teams
- Track improvement over time
- Extract actionable insights from call data

### **Solution**
An AI-powered feedback system that processes call recordings and provides detailed analysis including sentiment analysis, talk-time ratios, objection handling, closing techniques, and personalized improvement recommendations.

5. **Closing Technique Agent**: Analyzes closing attempts and effectiveness
6. **Question Quality Agent**: Evaluates discovery questions and techniques
7. **Product Knowledge Agent**: Assesses technical accuracy and product positioning

### **Agent Output Format**
Each agent should provide:
- **Score**: Numerical rating (1-10)
- **Key Insights**: 3-5 bullet points
- **Specific Examples**: Quotes from transcript
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Actionable recommendations

---

## **User Interface Requirements**

### **Input Page**
- Clean, intuitive file upload interface
- Form fields for call metadata
- Progress indicators for processing
- Error handling and validation

### **Dashboard Page**
- Overall call score and rating
- Individual agent feedback sections
- Key metrics visualization
- Transcript viewer with highlights
- Export functionality

---

## **Development Approach & Methodology**

### **Phase 1: MVP Development (2-3 weeks)**
1. **Week 1**: Setup basic Streamlit app with file upload and transcription
2. **Week 2**: Implement core AI agents and feedback generation
3. **Week 3**: Build dashboard, testing, and refinement

### **Phase 2: Enhancement (1-2 weeks)**
1. Enhanced UI/UX
2. Additional AI agents
3. Export functionality
4. Performance optimization

### **Recommended Development Process**
1. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Create virtual environment
   - Install required dependencies
   - Setup version control (Git)

2. **Build Core Components**
   - Start with basic Streamlit interface
   - Implement file upload and validation
   - Add transcription service integration

3. **Implement AI Agents**
   - Begin with 2-3 core agents
   - Test with sample data
   - Gradually add more specialized agents

4. **Integration & Testing**
   - End-to-end testing with real recordings
   - User feedback collection
   - Performance optimization

---

## **Execution Flow**

### **User Journey**
```
1. User uploads call recording file
2. User fills in call metadata (participants, context, type)
3. System validates inputs and starts processing
4. Audio transcription begins (with progress indicator)
5. AI agents analyze transcript in parallel
6. System generates comprehensive feedback report
7. User views dashboard with insights and recommendations
8. User can export report or save for future reference
```

### **Technical Workflow**
```
Input Validation → File Processing → Transcription → 
Speaker Identification → AI Agent Analysis → 
Feedback Aggregation → Report Generation → UI Display
```
